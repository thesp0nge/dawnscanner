    # codesake-dawn when in development has RELASE equal to '(development)' and
    # the version number is set for the next release.
    #
    # Each codesake-dawn major release will have a Disney Pixar Cars / Cars2
    # character as codename. My son Daniele loves those films and since I love
    # him too, # this is a kinda sort of tribute of my son's passion.
